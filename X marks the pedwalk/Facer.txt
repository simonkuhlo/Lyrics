#INTRO
(It were as if we felt no fear)

#VERSE
The scream is in your head now
You don't want to be in here
The silence starts to shout
The noises will move on now
You can get on out of here
What are you wishing for?

#VERSE
Will you feel up to the scheme
Time is standing still
You have a two way gun
That gun is breaking in your head like a pin
Your voice is just a whispering

#CHORUS
Facer
And will you tell the world your fears
Tell me now
Facer
Will your eyes see the brightening light
Or will they hide into the night

#VERSE
Your system seems to be like a rigor can you see it
It's not a real rot
What you now want to see the rising sun to make
A clean sweep of your scrape
And inside your head you visualize your plight
Still searching for the light
And you haven't been completely truthful or real
I want to make you feel
The scrapes are reigning here

#CHORUS
Facer
And will you tell the world your fears
Tell me now
Facer
Will your eyes see the brightening light
Or will they hide into the night

#HOOK

What are you wishing for?

#CHORUS

And will you tell the world your fears
Tell me now

Will your eyes see the brightening light
Or will they hide into the night

Will your eyes see the brightening light
Or will they hide into the night
