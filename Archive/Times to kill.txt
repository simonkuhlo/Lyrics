#VERSE
These are times to kill, to kill
The day I've lost is somewhere inside myself
myself
myself

You are mine
You are mine
Please, don't go
I don't feel so well

Please, don't
Please, don't
You must understand
It's what I am

I am

Disintegration
I am
I am
Disintegration

#VERSE
These are days to say goodbye
Tomorrow brings a silence inside my heart
my heart
my heart

You are wrong
You are right
Please, don't say
I don't even care

Please, don't
Please, don't
You must understand
The way we are

We are
Disintegration
We are
We are
Disintegration
